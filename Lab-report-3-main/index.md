## Choice 1

1.1 **`.ssh/config` file edit**: This is my `.ssh/config` and I used `vim` to edit it.

1.2 **`ssh` loggin alias**: The alias I choose is simply `ieng6` since I feel like it is really effective and easy to remember.

 1.3 **`scp` a file using loggin alias**: there is a word file named `1M.docx` on my computer and I transfered it to the remote computer and named it `1MRemote.docx`
